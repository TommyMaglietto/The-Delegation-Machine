# The Delegation Machine (V4)

The **V4 Delegation Machine** is a state-of-the-art framework for autonomous multi-agent software engineering. It evolves beyond a simple delegation pipeline into a flawless, self-healing, zero-trust ecosystem.

By enforcing strict separation of powers, self-modifying protocols, and automated deadlock resolution, this system guarantees that no hallucination, regression, or architectural flaw makes it into production.

## Core Principles

1.  **Zero-Trust Agent Architecture:** Agents are strictly firewalled into Legislative (Planning), Executive (Implementation), and Judicial (Verification) branches.
2.  **Two-Key Approval:** No code merges without cryptographic/system-verified approval from both an Implementer and an Independent Reviewer (Separation of Powers).
3.  **Meta-Cognition (Prompts Writing Prompts):** The Orchestrator compiles unique, hyper-specific instruction sets per micro-task rather than relying on degraded generic prompts.
4.  **Autonomous State Management:** Implementation cannot begin until rigorous pre-flight logic gates (Context Pruning -> Red Teaming -> TDD Generation) are cleared.
5.  **Virtual Context Management (VCM):** An OS-inspired memory architecture that enables agents to "page in" graph relationships and "page out" raw logs, effectively bypassing standard LLM token limits.

## Repository Contents

*   `MASTER_AI_PROCEDURES.md`: The definitive operational rulebook for the multi-agent system, covering the 3-Branch System, State Machines, and Escalation Protocols.
*   `CONTEXT_AND_MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`: The technical blueprint for the system's data pipeline, detailing Working Memory (VCM), Episodic Trajectories (Observation Masking), and Semantic Memory (Hybrid GraphRAG).

## Getting Started

Review the `MASTER_AI_PROCEDURES.md` document first to understand the agent roles and the flow of the Pre-Flight State Machine. Then, refer to `CONTEXT_AND_MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` to see how long-term memory and context handoffs are engineered.
